Conky is a method to auto-place text, graphics & all sorts of useful stuff on your desktop. In this case we are emphasising placing the local weather report (gathered across the â€™net from your nearest Airport) plus an analogue Barometer on the desktop. I work under Devuan (a systemD-free variant of Debian) so all my help is going to come from the assumption that you have a similar setup to work with.
